This prototype gives us an idea for possible depression/psychological disorder detection system.
# How does it work?
The program cleans the given review from the numbers,special characters and end of the line breaks. Then we extract 2000 features from the review using the TFIDF vectorizer. After that, we add 9 additional features. How many words, special characters and stopwords are counted before the sentiment analysis applied to the inspection and cleaning takes place. Using the deep neural network with dense layers, we can predict whether the overview will be classified as good or bad.
