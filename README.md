This prototype gives us an idea for possible depression/psychological disorder detection system.
# How does it work?
the program clean the given review from the numbers,speacial characters and end of the line breaks and then we extract 2000 features from the review using the TFIDF vectorizer after that we add 9 additional  features which are related to sentiment analysis applied to the review and counting how many words, speacial characters, and stopwords befor the cleaning occur. and using the deep neural network which conain Dense layers we can predict if the overall review is classified as good or bad.
